# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-Using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that classifies emotions from speech audio. Using MFCC feature extraction, the model learns patterns in speech data and predicts the corresponding emotional state.
